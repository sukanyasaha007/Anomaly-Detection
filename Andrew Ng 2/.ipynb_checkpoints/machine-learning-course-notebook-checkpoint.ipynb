A good trick is to try your algorithm for a set of values like $\\alpha = \\{0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03....1, 3\\}$ and inspect the $J$ convergence plots to identify the best rate.\n",

Consider classifying an image as *car* vs. *not car*. Each data point, $x$, is an image of identical size/resolution which corresponds to a list of pixel intensity values (each pixel is a feature). For a 50x50 pixel image, a model including all terms up to quadratic power would have 3 million features!\n",

A *layer* is a set of such units, each with it's own weights. A *network* is a formed by stacking these layers such that the outputs of one layer are the inputs to the layer above it. The real input data are the bottommost layer, the output of the topmost layer is the final output of the model, and intermediate layers are called *hidden layers*. Each interface between a layer is represented by a matrix which gives the \"weight\" on the output from neuron $x_i$ in the lower layer feeding into neuron $x_j$ in the top layer. Some mathematical defintions:\n",

Imagine you have split your data into training and CV subsets. How will $J_\\textrm{train}$ and $J_\\textrm{CV}$ change if you were fit a specific hypothesis starting with just a single point in the training set and then  progressively using more points in the training set to fit? ($J_\\textrm{CV}$ is calculated on the full CV set each time). Since it is easy to fit on one or two points we expect $J_\\textrm{train}$ to start low, but then it should increase as we add more points into the fitting procedure and hopefully begin to flatten out. On the other hand, since we are probably not getting a very *good* estimate of parameters by using only one or two training points, we expect $J_\\textrm{CV}$ to start high, and hopefully decrease as we use more and more training points for the fit. **This plot of $J_\\textrm{train}$ (calculated on the truncated training set) and $J_\\textrm{CV}$ as a function of $m_\\textrm{train}$ is a Learning Curve.**\n",

Conversely, overfitting manifests as a large $J_\\textrm{CV}$ which decreases slowly with $m_\\textrm{train}$, though it will look like the two losses would converge if extrapolated out to very large number of training points.\n",

Similarly, identify different potential types of features in these failed points, and work on improving your representation of those features with high occurence.** For instance, a spam classifying email may fail most frequently on phishing emails, or failed data points may contain a lot of unusual punctution - these are then both worth more attention. \n",

    "# Week7: SVM Discussion With David\n",
    "The idea of setting each training point to a landmark and using the Gaussian kernel for SVM struck David as very similar to Kernel Density Estimation. This is a technique for estimating the generating distribution of some random variable $X$ that you have $n$ observations of. The estimate of the density is formed by a mixture of Gaussians centered at all the observations and all weighted by $1/n$. For classification you can imagine making estimating a density for the $y=0$ points and likewise for the $y=1$ points, and then classifying new points based on which ever density gave the highest probability. Such a method doesn't take into account relative frequency of the two labels, but you could do so by taking a Bayesian with a prior taken from the relative frequencies and a likelihood taken from the density estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In SVM with a Gaussian Kernel, if you take every training point to be a landmark, then the quantity $\\theta^Tf$ is a weighted mixture of Gaussians. In contrast to classification with the kernel density estimates, the Gaussians resulting from the $y=1$ and $y=0$ points are combined into the mixture but their coefficients will have opposite sign. Consequently the sign of $\\theta^Tf$ which dictates the binary hypothesis output serves as a comparator between the \"density estimate\" of the $y=1$ points, and the \"density estimate\" of the $y=0$ points. However here there is another difference that the Gaussian weightings are not all equal at $1/n$ but rather are the fitted values $\\theta$.\n",

We will always get a smaller $J$ by adding an additional cluster, but the rate at which $J$ decreases with $K$ will be initially large, but later it will be small once $K$ is larger than the true number of clusters (since we aren't gaining as much by finer splitting of clusters). For some data sets this change in behavior results in a sharp kink or \"elbow\" in the $J$ versus $K$ plot. \n",

    "Your n-dimensional data set starts out expressed in the basis of the measured variables (observables), but imagine doing a change of basis to express the same data points in a new basis of *composite variables*. Each data point now has a component in each of the composite directions. **For some composite directions, the data points may all have similar components, this means the composite variable corresponding to that direction can't have much explanatory power in predicting the response variable (if you're doing function estimation with your data). If you're doing density estimation you might say that the composite variable doesn't have any significant randomness to it. One very common reason this might happen is if some of your observables are correlated. **\n",

One trick you can use to avoid this trap is to take your data set and swap all the response variable values in a randomized way, and then repeat the PCA and visualization. If you do this a few times and then look at the panel of visualizations you should be able to clearly pick out the one from the real data set as distinguishing the response variable values much more than the others."

This is infeasible for large or out-of-memory sets. An alternative is Stochastic Gradient Descent which loops through the training points one at a time and for each point it updates all the parameters to fit that single point a little better. SGD will converge in a more circuitous way and continue to wander around in the neighborhood of the minimum, although you can ameliorate this by using a slowly decreasing learning rate.

    "There are many examples in e-commerce now of websites or web apps that are privy to a continuous stream of data from their users. **Online learning refers to letting a ML algorithm continually learn as it receives each new observation from the stream, like a stochastic gradient descent that never ends!** This lets the learned parameters change over time if the underlying behavior of the system is changing, and also allows you to use and then immediately discard data rather than having to warehouse it. Predicting click through rate on high traffic websites is a very common example of such a system. Recommender systems are also often run in this fashion.\n",

    "A good example is a shipping service where visitor to the site inputs their desired origin and destination, is shown a price, and either purchases or doesn't purchase the service. We'd like a model that gives the probability that the purchase will be made based on the three features (origin, destination and price) so we can decide how to set prices. This could be set up as a simple logistic regression model on the server, which learns it's parameters $\\theta$ by SGD using the stream of observations being generated in real time from the site. \n",

    "# Week 11: Application Example - Photo OCR\n",
    "The photo OCR problem is how to get computers to recognize text in images. This has been well solved for scanned text documents but is still difficult with actual pictures. \n",

    "## Pipelines\n",
    "A typical approach to this problem would be:\n",
    "- identify regions of text in the image\n",
    "- segment each region into individual character images\n",
    "- run a classifier on each individual character image\n",

    "### Step 1: Text Detection\n",
    "For the first step of text detection we can use a sliding window approach. For instance, to find pedestrians in images you decide on a rectangle aspect ratio typical to a pedestrian, you find a bunch of positive (pedestrian) and negative (non-pedestrian) images cropped to those dimensions, and you train a classifier. Then you take your original image and slide a rectanglar window around to different locations (according to a \"step-size\" parameter) on the full image, running your classifier at each location. You would need to do this with different rectangle sizes to capture pedestrians at different distances from the camera (and each rectange then need to be rescaled to match the pixel dimensions that you trained your classifier on). For text detection you do a similar procedure, but then you need to use an \"expansion operator\" that will combine neighboring regions identified as text (since they are probably part of the same word or sentence). Finally, since we expect regions of text to have a certain aspect ratio we can discard e.g. circular regions.\n",

    "### Step 2: Character Segmentation\n",
    "For the second step we can take each identified text region and use a uni-directional sliding window technique to pan across it in steps, running a classifier on the sub-image at each step. In this case our classifier should be trained on example images of text where there is a space separating two characters on either side of the image ($y=1$) i.e. we are trying to find the spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artificial Data Synthesis\n",
    "This comes in two flavors, creating new data from scratch versus amplifying an existing small set of data. For the character classification example you can grab images of one or a few characters from vast font libraries and paste them againt random backgrounds (usually with some added blurring or other distortion). Alternatively you can take each existing image in your set and apply different random distortions to it to produce new samples! **The key to synthesizing *useful* new data is that that the new elements should be representative of what you expect to see in the test set. Ideally the noise and distortion used should have a physically realistic basis - it usually doesn't help to add completely random noise.**\n",

    "As always, make sure you have a low-bias classifier (add new features as needed) before bother to get more data. Note that sometimes manually gather and labeling more data yourself takes less time than you might think.\n",

    "## Ceiling Analysis\n",
    "Which component in the pipeline should you allocate your scarce resources to? **First you need a single real number evaluation metric for result of the full pipeline.** In this example we could use fraction of characters in a test set of images that we classify correctly. Run your test set images through your actual pipeline to get a value for this, say 72%. Now you go in and manually do the job of the first component in your pipeline e.g. you manually draw rectanges around the text in the test set images. How much does the final metric improve when you do this step perfectly by hand? Now repeat this but also manually do the second stage (character segmentation) with perfect accuracy. How much does this improve the final metric? \n",

Next you manually provide perfect \"answers\" for the first component of the pipeline and see how much the final score improves, then add in perfect answers for the second component and see again the improvement. Large jumps in improvement indicate a component where there is a large upside to your final metric if you can make improvements.
